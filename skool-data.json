        "content": "This is a complete review of [Skool.com](https://jessekroon.com/skool).\n\nSkool is a community platform for creators.\n\nIf this sounds interesting:\n\n*   Run your courses, community & event schedule on one simple platform\n*   Relieve your community members from ads and distractions\n*   Reward people for being active/adding value with gamification\n*   Have people log in daily, take action and feel accountable\n*   Grow community engagement, with little effort from you\n\nThen Skool might be right for you.\n\nThe best part?\n\nIn the past 12 months I ran my own private Skool group as a business owner, and have been a participating member of multiple other groups.\n\nSo in this review we’ll cover what it’s like to [run your own Skool group](https://jessekroon.com/skool) and what it’s like to be a member of someone else’s.\n\nLet’s dive right in.\n\nWhat is Skool?\n--------------\n\nSkool lets you put your course, community, and event schedule together in one place.\n\nBy offering a simple to use all-in-one solution it replaces the need to use separate tools like Kajabi or Teachable to run your courses and MightNetworks, Circle or Facebook Groups to run your community.\n\n![Image 1](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f0e_skool-home.png)\n\nCo-founded by Sam Ovens, the platform launched in 2019 with a closed beta and has been publicly available since early 2022.\n\nWith a steady release of new features and growing customer base, one thing is for sure:\n\nSkool is here to stay.\n\nWho is Skool for?\n-----------------\n\nIf you are a:\n\n*   Business owner\n*   Coach / consultant\n*   Educator\n*   Course creator\n*   Youtuber\n\nAnd you want to:\n\nTeach or gather together people into a single, distraction and advertisement free community, where you have complete control over all the content these people see.\n\nThen [Skool.com](https://jessekroon.com/skool) might be right for you.\n\nLet's dissect and review the Skool platform piece by piece, so you can make a well-informed decision whether it's the right choice for you.\n\nThe 4 main features of Skool\n----------------------------\n\nBasically, a Skool group consists of four main features:\n\n1.  Community\n2.  Classroom\n3.  Calendar\n4.  Gamification\n\nWithin the **community** people can engage with each other via posts, likes, comments and direct chat messages:\n\n![Image 2](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f0f_skool-community-tab.png)\n\nIn the **classroom** your customers can learn by following your courses/training programs:\n\n![Image 3](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f10_skool-cassroom-tab.png)\n\nVia the **calendar** you can schedule online and offline events such as recurring calls, webinars and meetups for you and your members:\n\n![Image 4](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f11_skool-calendar-tab.png)\n\n**Gamification** awards points to members for each 'like' they get on their posts/comments. Reach a certain amount of points and you 'level up'. Rewards can be linked to each level to boost engagement.\n\nLeaderboards show the most active members and rewards for each level:\n\n![Image 5](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f12_skool-leaderboards-tab.png)\n\nThe community of a [Skool](https://jessekroon.com/skool) group looks like this:\n\n![Image 6](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f14_skool-feature-1-community.png)\n\nIt’s a clean interface, where you can pretty much do two things:\n\n1.  Post something yourself.\n2.  Read and engage with posts of other members.\n\n_(more later on the types of posts you can do in a Skool community)_\n\nHere’s a screenshot of your average Facebook group:\n\n![Image 7](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f0b_facebook-group.png)\n\nThey look similar and you can post/engage with other people’s posts in a Facebook group too.\n\nBut on Facebook, there’s always so much going on.\n\nVisiting Facebook and navigating to your group feels like navigating through a busy shopping street.\n\nSomething or someone is always fighting for your attention.\n\n**With Skool, as you log in, you simply land in a nice little oasis.**\n\nIn the past 12 months I have always found it a nice experience to spend time in a Skool community. Both as a member, and as an admin.\n\n### Posting in a Skool community\n\nBoth members and admins can post in a [Skool community](https://jessekroon.com/skool)\n\nYou can attach files, images, GIFs and videos (YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, Wistia, or Bunny.net) to your post. It's possible to run polls too.\n\n![Image 8](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f13_skool-community-new-post.png)\n\nWhen posting something, you do so in a specific category.\n\nThis helps to keep posts organized. Your members can easily view posts by category via pill menu and use the filter button to sort posts, which is handy for finding specific information quickly:\n\n![Image 9](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f15_skool-community-filter.png)\n\nAs an admin you can set up categories as you like.\n\nYou even can set up specific categories where only you as an admin can post, and your members can only view posts.\n\n### User profiles, chat and notifications\n\nEach community member also has a public profile page:\n\n![Image 10](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f16_skool-user-profile.png)\n\nOn a profile page you can see:\n\n*   All community activity of that person, like what they posted and when, and what they commented on posts by other people\n*   Groups created by this person (can be hidden on group level)\n\n*   Groups they are a member of (can be hidden on group level)\n\nFollowing someone means you get notified whenever that person posts.\n\nBesides that, you can start a 1-on-1 chat (there currently is no group chat feature).\n\n[![Image 11: skool-direct-message-feature](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6ede_feature-1-chat-sam-ovens.png)](https://jessekroon.com/skool)\n\nYou can always find all your chats and notifications in the top right of the screen:\n\n![Image 12: Skool chat notification](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6ead_chat-notification.webp)\n\n### Skool Community feature - In conclusion\n\nSkool delivers when it comes to the necessary elements needed to [build a thriving community](https://jessekroon.com/skool):\n\nFor members, they offer a supportive environment without distractions where you can engage and connect with other members, feel accountable and consistently work towards a common goal and even specific rewards.\n\nThe chat feature allows members to privately connect with other members as well as admins to discuss specific topics and exchange knowledge which facilitates the building of relationships even further.\n\n**Also “time to value” is extremely fast. When entering a new community the learning curve is about 3 seconds.**\n\nFor admins, they’re simple to set up, easy to use, low maintenance, and more importantly, you can make them fun with gamification (which we'll touch upon at feature #4).\n\nFeature #2 - The Classroom\n--------------------------\n\nThe classroom is the second main feature of a [Skool group](https://jessekroon.com/skool).\n\nThis is where your members can follow your courses.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n![Image 13](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f17_skool-feature-2-classroom.png)\n\nIf you add more than one course, members will first have to select which course they’d like to see when visiting the classroom tab:\n\n![Image 14](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f18_skool-feature-2-classroom-2.png)\n\nYou can add as many courses to the classroom as you like.\n\nNote: if you don't add any courses to your group, the classroom tab will be hidden.\n\n### Setting up your course(s) is easy\n\nSetting up your course takes a few minutes, via the classroom tab you simply add a new course.\n\n![Image 15](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f2d_skool-add-a-course.png)\n\nAccess to a course can be set to:\n\n*   All members can access\n*   Members unlock at a specific level\n*   Members pay a 1-time price to unlock\n*   Members unlock after x days\n*   Members you select can access\n\nIf members unlock at a certain level, you can decide which level members have to reach in order for the course to be unlocked in the classroom.\n\n_(reaching a level ties into the gamification aspect, more on that in a minute at feature #4)_\n\nNext, you simply use the inline/drag-and-drop editor to add and arrange the modules in your course:\n\n[![Image 16: skool-classroom-add-modules-to-course](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6ee2_new-feature-2-add-course-inline-editor.png)](https://jessekroon.com/skool)\n\nEach module can include:\n\n*   One video\n*   Description (linked video timestamps are supported)\n*   Multiple links\n*   Multiple files\n*   Actions items\n*   Transcript (this makes video content searchable)\n*   Drip release to delay access (can be turned on/off per module)\n\nSkool (as of yet) doesn’t offer video hosting, so you will have to upload your videos to either YouTube/Vimeo/Wistia/Loom/Bunny.net and enter the link while setting up a module:\n\n### Skool Classroom feature - In conclusion\n\nAgain, Skool comes through by providing a sleek looking [course delivery platform](https://jessekroon.com/skool) via the Classroom feature.\n\nFor members, the classroom is a place where you can easily navigate to, to continue your personal learning process. The user interface works well and members intuitively find their way without any learning curve.\n\n**I’ve never had any of my customers ask me questions about how to use the classroom.**\n\nThat’s a pretty good sign.\n\nFor admins, courses are easy to set up (it takes a few minutes). You won't need to reference any guides or tutorials, as the interface is so intuitive.\n\nThere’s enough flexibility to set up your modules pretty much however you like - descriptions, timestamps, files, links, action items, transcripts - it’s all there.\n\nYou can’t edit the layout and what goes where, but there’s also no need for that in my opinion. The default layout works well.\n\nA downside for some people is that you have to host your own videos. For me personally that’s not an issue, but I’ve seen other Skool users ask about this feature quite some times.\n\nLastly, if you want to use student testing tools to assess someone's understanding of the material you're teaching (using a quiz for example) you will have to use a 3rd party tool (like [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/)).\n\nStudent testings tools aren't available in Skool (yet).\n\nNow let’s look at the calendar.\n\nFeature #3 - The Calendar\n-------------------------\n\nThe third main feature of a [Skool group](https://jessekroon.com/skool) is the calendar feature, which looks like this:\n\n![Image 17](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f19_skool-feature-2-calendar.png)\n\nIt’s basically a public agenda where you can schedule (recurring) online and offline events for all your members to see.\n\nNote: if you don't add any events to your group, the calendar tab will be hidden until you add one.\n\nScheduling an event works intuitively and is similar to Google calendar:\n\n![Image 18](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f2a_skool-calendar-event.png)\n\nSimply enter a title and choose the date, time, duration and timezone for your event.\n\nYou can also choose to send your members an email 24-hours prior to the calendar event (this works very well to increase show up rate).\n\nNote: you still need a tool like Zoom or Google Meets to run the meeting. Skool doesn’t offer this service.\n\n\u200d**The time of the event is automatically converted to the timezone of each individual member too**.\n\nFinally no more confusion about timezones!\n\nMembers can click on the event to view the description or to add the event to an external calendar like Google, Apple, Outlook, Outlook.com and Yahoo:\n\n![Image 19](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f1b_skool-feature-3-calendar-call.png)\n\nThe event that’s coming up next is also highlighted in the community to tab:\n\n![Image 20](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f0c_Screenshot%202024-07-07%20at%2011.20.48.png)\n\nIf you click on it, you go straight to the details of the event, pretty nice!\n\n**Tip:** If you run Q&A calls, record them and post them in a designated category in the community, so your members can go back and view the recording whenever they want.\n\nYou can even go all out and have your Q&A calls transcribed, which will make them searchable via Skool’s search feature!\n\n### Skool Calendar feature - In conclusion\n\nThe calendar feature is simple, but adds a ton of value to the entire experience of Skool.\n\nFor members, it’s easy to see when events are coming up and accessing them is usually just a few clicks away.\n\nAutomatic timezone conversion instantly makes it clear when events happen, no matter where you are in the world.\n\nForgetting about an event happens rarely with the email reminder, add to calendar feature and notification in the community tab.\n\nFor admins, setting up events is done in a few clicks. Expect to receive much less to possibly even zero questions about when events happen or how to access them.\n\nBesides that, show up rates are boosted without any effort from your side with an email reminder and notification in the community tab.\n\nFeature #4 - Gamification\n-------------------------\n\nNow onto one of the coolest features, gamification.\n\nIf a member posts or comments something valuable, other community members can like that post/comment:\n\n![Image 21](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f1c_skool-post-likes.png)\n\n**Likes translate into points** which are linked to a level connected to a user’s profile.\n\n![Image 22](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f1d_skool-profile-level.png)\n\n_(Sam Ovens is currently level 7 in this specific_ [_Skool group_](https://jessekroon.com/skool)_)._\n\n**Reach a certain amount of points, and you level up** (there are 9 levels, which you can also give custom names to).\n\nCommunity members who gather the most points (by adding the most value to your community) are listed on the leaderboards of your Skool group:\n\n![Image 23](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f1e_skool-leaderboards-profile-level.png)\n\n**As an admin, you can connect rewards to each specific level.**\n\nFor example, when you reach level 6 in the group of the screenshot above, you unlock the ability to chat with other members and post in the community tab (this prevents spam and low quality posts).\n\nYou can also unlock classroom content at a certain level. When a member reaches the level your choose,  the course will automatically come available in the classroom tab of the same group.\n\nBesides unlocking content in the classroom, you can pretty much give any reward you like.\n\nYou could for example give away a free 1-on-1 coaching call to the #1 person on the 30-day leaderboard each month.\n\n### Skool Gamification feature - In conclusion\n\n**Setting up rewards with gamification works insanely well.**\n\nWhat better way to grow community engagement (with little effort from you)?\n\nEvery member of the community has an incentive to take part and add as much value as possible to get their rewards.\n\nEspecially with the leaderboard tab showing your points, progress, and how you compare to other members.\n\nThe best part?\n\nYour community members decide what’s most valuable, which creates a peaceful harmony and great balance in your group. Spamming posts to get points isn’t a thing.\n\nMore noteworthy features\n------------------------\n\nNow that we have gone over the four main features of a [Skool group](https://jessekroon.com/skool), let’s look at some other noteworthy features.\n\n### Charge money for membership to your community\n\nSkool let's you charge money for membership to your community!\n\nSkool replaces your landing page, order form, merchant account, and everything else — it does everything, end-to-end, seamlessly. You simply add a price:\n\n![Image 24](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f2b_skool-subscription-settings.png)\n\nNext, you get some members and voila, you make money!\n\n![Image 25](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f2c_skool-dashboard.png)\n\nCurrently Skool only supports a monthly membership fee, one-time payments are not supported (yet).\n\n### Send email broadcasts about your post (admin only)\n\nAs an admin, you have the ability to send an email broadcast to all your [Skool group](https://jessekroon.com/skool) members about your post (you can only do this once every 72 hours):\n\n![Image 26](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6ef4_New-broadcast-email-function-in-post.png)\n\nHere’s what the email that your members receive looks like:\n\n![Image 27](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6ef5_New-broadcast-email-preview.png)\n\nIf you add images or other media in your post, they will also show up in the email.\n\nThe deliverability of the email is solid, I’ve never had any of these emails go to the spam folder.\n\nThis is a great feature to inform your members about updates or promotions you're running, without them needing to log in to see your post.\n\n### Skool's single search box\n\n[Skool.com](https://jessekroon.com/skool) has a single search box to search all:\n\n*   Posts\n*   Comments\n*   Course content \n*   Member profiles\n\nSearch results look like this:\n\n![Image 28](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f1f_skool-search-feature.png)\n\nVia the tabs you can switch between types of search results.\n\nPretty simple and works well.\n\n### Chat & Email notifications settings\n\nMembers can easily decide if they’re available to chat with and which emails they receive regarding notifications, including the frequency of those emails:\n\n![Image 29](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f20_skool-notification-settings.png)\n\n**It’s possible to change the timing of each type of notification and you can even turn them off completely.**\n\nThis is great for members, as it lets them adjust how the platform works for them so that they can focus on their work instead of getting bombarded with notifications they don’t want or get too frequently.\n\nFor admins, these notifications are great for getting members to come back to your group.\n\n### Group metrics (admin only)\n\nAs you an admin, you get access to some neat metrics like:\n\n*   Total members\n*   Active members\n*   Daily activity\n\n![Image 30](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f22_skool-group-metrics.png)\n\nThis helps to get an understanding how well your group is performing, and where you can improve.\n\n### Public vs Private Skool groups\n\nWhen creating [your own Skool group](https://jessekroon.com/skool), you can choose to either make your group public or private:\n\n![Image 31](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f23_public-privage-group-setting.png)\n\n_(you can change this setting later at any time after creating your group too)_\n\n**A private group** means that only members can see who’s in the group and what they post, all the content is hidden from search engines. These are great for gated content, like paid courses and masterminds.\n\n**A public group** means anyone can see who’s in the group and what they post. Content is indexed and discoverable by search engines.\n\nThese work well for running public communities around your brand and products. You can also use them to generate leads, nurture them and from there on convert them to your paid group.\n\nNote: before people can post/comment in a public group they first need to request access, which an admin will have to approve.\n\n### Community members can invite friends to join\n\nAll members can share a link to your group with their friends:\n\n![Image 32](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f21_skool-invite-friend-to-community.png)\n\nThis is a very nice feature if you’re planning on running a public group because it can greatly grow your following without any effort on your side.\n\n**Tip**: You should pin a ‘Welcome & how to get started’ post in your community and include clear step-by-step instructions on how members can invite friends.\n\n#### Ask up to 3 questions when people request to join your group\n\nIf someone requests approval to join your group, you can ask them up to 3 questions.\n\n![Image 33](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f25_plugin-questions.png)\n\nThis is handy to get additional info about the members who want to join, and maybe even to decide if you want to let them into your group or not based on their answers.\n\nYou can ask members up to 3 multiple choice or open ended questions. You can also ask them for their email address.\n\nOh, and you can send all answers to your CRM via Skool’s Zapier integration.\n\n### Welcome new members with an automated DM message\n\nSkool lets you set up an automated direct message that's sent as soon as someone joins your group.\n\n![Image 34](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f24_plugin-auto-dm.png)\n\nThis is great to instantly welcome new group members and instruct them on how to get started using your community.\n\n### Skool mobile app for iOS and Android\n\nSkool has a mobile app available both for iOS and Android devices.\n\nInstalling the app means you're able to receive push notifications about certain posts (depending on your notification settings).\n\nBoth apps work great and they're very fast!\n\nSkool pricing\n-------------\n\nSkool pricing is as simple as the software itself.\n\nThere’s [one plan](https://www.skool.com/pricing?ref=856ac2d7e2d04fc9bcbead26611d6501) with everything included which costs $99 /month.\n\n![Image 35](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6e67/668ba1ae04a4fff0cf6f6f28_skool%20pricing.png)\n\nNote that this is the price per group.\n\nIf you want multiple Skool groups, you’ll have to pay $99 /month per group.\n\nSkool does offer [a free 14-day trial via this link](https://jessekroon.com/skool).\n\nCurrently there is no free plan.\n\n### Skool discount & special deals\n\nCurrently there are no discounts or special deals available for Skool.com.\n\nBut as soon as there are, I’ll make sure to update this post accordingly.\n\nThe best deal you can get at the moment is the [free 14-day trial](https://jessekroon.com/skool).\n\n### How to get your Skool group for free\n\nCreating your own Skool group costs money, but Skool has [an auto affiliate system](https://www.skool.com/features?ref=856ac2d7e2d04fc9bcbead26611d6501).\n\nIf someone creates a group from your group, you get 40% commission for life ($39 /month per group).\n\nThat means if 3 people create a group from yours, you’ve made back the monthly cost + an extra $18.\n\nSkool customer support\n----------------------\n\nPersonally I've never had to ask for support in a whole year of using Skool, the platform is self-explanatory.\n\nBut if you do need support, you can contact the Skool team via email. I've heard they reply pretty fast.\n\nYou can also ask questions or chat with the Skool team in the [public Skool community.](https://www.skool.com/community?invite=cc66e2e875e64ed19f2ea2a64eda684f)\n\nIn the public community you can expect to get an answer within a couple hours, either from the team behind Skool or other Skool users.\n\nConclusion: Is Skool worth it?\n------------------------------\n\n[Skool](https://www.jessekroon.com/skool) is free of unnecessary features, very easy to use and the combination of running your community, courses and calendar on one single platform works very well.\n\nThe learning curve for Skool is about 3 seconds, both for members and admins.\n\nThis makes the platform accessible to everyone, no matter the level of technical skill.\n\nIf someone joins your Skool group, there won’t be any confusion about features or options filling the screen, which can heavily derail the overall experience of your members.\n\nThis also means Skool is very suitable if you have a course or want to start a community for a “non-techie” target group.\n\nOnce you get your group going, Skool offers very solid mechanisms to grow your group and retain your members, while at the same time not overwhelming them wilt alerts, notifications and emails.\n\nDo you sell courses? The awesome thing about [Skool](https://www.jessekroon.com/skool) is that it lets you put a community at the center of your customers' learning experience.\n\nCourses without a community can feel empty, boring and are much less engaging.\n\nWith Skool, your customers will feel more excitement, accountability and motivation to keep working towards their goals as they feel part of something larger than themselves.\n\nWho doesn't want a higher course completion rate and more success for their customers?\n\nThe possibility for people to connect (via the community and direct chat) means they can easily help each other whenever they get stuck, instead of only turning to you for support.\n\nThe cherry on top?\n\nGamification, which gives all community members a common goal:\n\nTo add as much value as possible to unlock course material or any other reward you’ve defined.\n\n**This makes your community grow faster and bigger without much effort on your side.**\n\nSkool has 3 cons, but there's a solution for 3 all of them.\n\nWhen Sam Ovens [introduced Skool](https://jessekroon.com/skool) he said:\n\n_“Skool gives you everything you need, and nothing you don’t.”_\n\nAfter using Skool for 12 months, I can definitely say this is true.\n\nYou’ll find that whether you’re using Skool as a member, or as an admin, the experience on the platform is enjoyable at all times.\n\nI definitely encourage you to try Skool for yourself and see whether you like it!\n\n[Visit Skool.com](https://jessekroon.com/skool) or [create your own Skool group (14-day free trial)](https://jessekroon.com/skool).\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\u200d\n\n_Updated June 6, 2024_",

        "content": "![Image 1](https://samuelearp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mockup-featuring-a-macbook-pro-placed-on-a-teacher-s-desk-m17412-r-el2-1024x697.png)\n\nIn this article, I present a review of Skool, the best online community for creatives (2024); it is also a fantastic site for artists, creatives, coaches, businesses, and more. [Skool](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=b7203ac5662041df9d61a4cc215d8609) is a community and learning platform that I am really excited about. It is designed to help you monetize your skills and passion.\n\nI am a [landscape artist](https://samuelearp.com/blog/landscape-painting-tips/) and content creator who helps artists overcome their challenges with their painting techniques. I created an [Online Art School](https://www.skool.com/samuel-earp-online-art-school/about) on Skool to help the artist achieve their creative goals.\n\nI am so impressed with Skool that I felt compelled to write this blog post. I am a total Skool fanboy. I love the site and like what the CEO, Sam Ovens, and the team stand for. Most importantly, Skool has enabled me to create an engaged and thriving art community and allowed me to monetize my passion for painting.\n\nWhat is Skool.com?\n------------------\n\n[Skool](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=b7203ac5662041df9d61a4cc215d8609) is the ultimate community-building platform for creators, coaches, and businesses to create and manage online communities. It offers a range of features, including courses, various community-building tools, live events, and gamification to engage and connect with members.\n\nWith its easy-to-use and intuitive interface, Skool quickly becomes a top choice for building a thriving online community and monetizing your content.\n\nWhy I Created an Art Group on Skool\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn 2020, I joined Patreon to create a community and provide an affordable way for my subscribers to access my in-depth painting tutorial videos. I was active on Patreon for many years but the more painting tutorials I made and the more time I spent on the platform, the more I began to experience annoyances that were becoming a real problem.\n\nThe main issues I was experiencing with Patreon was that the user interface was clunky, and my subscribers had difficulty finding older videos. Also, the engagement on Patreon was low, and the fees were high.\n\nIn 2023, I discovered [Skool](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=b7203ac5662041df9d61a4cc215d8609) after I paid for a blogging course hosted on the site. Skool was so easy to use that I figured out how to use it within five minutes of being on the platform. My next thought was that Skool would be perfect for me to create an [Online Art School](https://www.skool.com/samuel-earp-online-art-school/about) to replace my Patreon community. Two months later, I created my own art school on Skool, and it was a game changer.\n\nUser-Friendly Interface\n-----------------------\n\n![Image 2](https://samuelearp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-15.32.31-1024x583.jpeg)\n\nOne of the main reasons I switched from Patreon to Skool was because of the user interface. Skool’s interface is clean, modern, and highly intuitive. It allows me to organize my content easily into different courses and lessons, making it much easier for my subscribers to find whatever online course they want. This has greatly improved their overall experience on my site.\n\nKey Features of Skool\n---------------------\n\nSkool utilizes six core features, which include the following:\n\nThis is the first thing you will see when you join a group on Skool. The community section is where members can interact, ask questions, share their experiences, post images and videos, and more.\n\nI encourage my community to share their artwork and ask questions. I also update my community on new painting tutorial videos and upcoming Zoom meetings, and I set painting challenges.\n\n### Classroom\n\nOne of the main core uses of Skool is to create courses and coaching programs. These course creators are all hosted in Skool’s ‘Classroom’ section.\n\nSkool allows you to make unlimited courses or create multiple courses where you can embed video links, for example, from YouTube, Vimeo, or Loom. You can also upload other course materials and resources, such as photos, PDF documents, and links.\n\n### Calendar\n\n![Image 3](https://samuelearp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-15.34.11-1024x686.jpeg)\n\nSkool is all about an engaging online community, and one of the best ways to engage your members is to hang out with them over Zoom. This is where the calendar section comes in, as this is the place to show the times and dates of your Zoom meetings, YouTube livestreams, and other events.\n\nThe Calendar shows you the time and date of the meeting events in your time zone, so there is no confusion.\n\n### Leaderboard\n\nThe Leaderboard is part of Skool’s gamification boost engagement aspect, which I will explain in just a moment. The Leaderboard shows the most engaged subscribers in your community.\n\n### Members\n\nThis is where you will see all of the members of your community.\n\n### About\n\nThe About page is on display to the public. Skool allows you to upload images and videos to illustrate what your community is about so you can make an informed decision about whether you would like to join. You also have 1000 characters to write a description or sales copy about your group.\n\n![Image 4](https://samuelearp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-15.33.25-1024x636.jpeg)\n\nSkool is completely community-focused and aims to provide all the necessary tools for creating a thriving community. Since switching over from Patreon and joining Skool, my subscribers have become more engaged and active. Many discussions are going on in the community with many of my members sharing their artwork.\n\nSkool’s Classroom Feature\n-------------------------\n\n![Image 5](https://samuelearp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-15.33.52-1024x602.jpeg)\n\nWhen I was looking for an alternative to Patreon, I wanted to find a way to categorize all of the courses and painting tutorial videos I had made.\n\nSkool’s Classroom feature was the perfect place for go to platform and I was able to categorize all of my videos with ease. My subscribers are happy because they can easily find the course they are looking for.\n\nGamification Experience: Learning Just Got Fun\n----------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 6](https://samuelearp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-16.27.31-1024x622.png)\n\nThis is one of the most unique features that Skool offers. Gamification refers to using game elements and design techniques in non-game contexts. In Skool, subscribers can earn points, badges, and ranks by completing tasks and participating in community discussions.\n\nYou can offer rewards and prizes and lock courses at certain levels to encourage engagement in your community. For example, I have a free Painters Hub community and locked some courses at certain levels. The members must engage in the group to unlock the courses and get points. This is done through other members liking your posts or comments.\n\nMonetizing Your Content\n-----------------------\n\n[Skool](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=b7203ac5662041df9d61a4cc215d8609) is all about making money from whatever you are passionate about; in my case, it is painting. You can create free and paid groups on Skool, and with its in-house payment processor, monetizing your content is easy.\n\nMy [Online Art School](https://www.skool.com/samuel-earp-online-art-school/about) hosted on Skool is a paid group, and I am charging a monthly subscription. I have also created a free group called Painters Hub, where I give away free content but use it as leads for my paid community.\n\nYou can set your own prices and charge whatever you want. If you don’t want to use Skool’s payment processor, you can use your own and then invite your customers to your community.\n\nExpert Team: The Masterminds Behind Skool\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSkool was created by Sam Ovens, an entrepreneur and business coach who has helped hundreds of businesses grow and scale. With his experience in creating successful online communities and frustration at using multiple tools to run a community, he saw a need for a community platform that combined all the necessary tools to manage communities in one place.\n\nSam Ovens designed the [Skool](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=b7203ac5662041df9d61a4cc215d8609) platform to be user-friendly and efficient for community leaders to manage their members. They aim to help you save time and money while providing top-notch online community management features.\n\nThe Skool team also includes a dedicated group of developers, designers, and customer support specialists who work tirelessly to ensure that the platform is constantly improving and meeting the needs of its users. They are always open to feedback and suggestions from community leaders to make Skool the best it can be.\n\nSkool Pricing Review\n--------------------\n\n![Image 7](https://samuelearp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-16.33.34-1024x864.png)\n\nSkool charges a flat rate of $99 monthly per community. For this, you get access to all of Skool’s features. If you are unsure whether Skool is right for you, they offer a 14-day free trial so you can start building your community immediately.\n\nDoes Skool Have a Free Plan?\n----------------------------\n\nNo, but Skool offers a 14-day free trial.\n\nSkool vs Kajabi Comparison\n--------------------------\n\nBefore I chose [Skool](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=b7203ac5662041df9d61a4cc215d8609) to create my Online Art School, I looked at other platforms, including Kajabi. Kajabi has a starting price of $149/month for their basic plan and goes up to $399/month for their pro plan.\n\nWhile they offer more features than Skool, the cost may be steep for those just starting out. With Skool’s flat rate of $99/month, you can save money while still having access to all the necessary tools to run a successful community.\n\nOn a personal note, I am a member of a community hosted on Kajabi. While the courses are easy to navigate and watch, the main annoyance for me is that the community is separate, and there is even a separate app for the Kajabi community members. Skool has one app with everything in it.\n\nI am not saying that Kajabi is bad, but I generally don’t resonate with the platform, and it is expensive. Skool is simple, but it makes it easy to use and engages your community members more.\n\nSkool vs Facebook Group\n-----------------------\n\nMany people chose to create free and paid communities or multiple groups using Facebook but there are many problems with this. First, Facebook does not provide all the necessary tools for community management. In fact, it can be quite difficult to keep track of members and engagement on a Facebook group.\n\nAdditionally, the platform is notorious for constantly changing its algorithms and making it more difficult for members to see content. This can greatly decrease engagement and limit the reach of important announcements or discussions within a community.\n\nI have been in private Facebook groups, and quite often, there is little engagement. Also, there is a lot of noise and distractions on Facebook, whereas school is the opposite; it provides a clean and distraction-free environment for members to connect and engage with each other.\n\nSkool vs Patreon\n----------------\n\nWhilst Patreon is a little different to Skool, the reason I have included it in this article is because I moved from Patreon over to Skool. Skool offers a better platform for building and engaging with your community.\n\nOne of the main differences between Skool and Patreon is the focus on community-building. While Patreon is primarily used for crowdfunding and supporting creators, Skool emphasizes creating a space for like-minded individuals to connect and grow together.\n\nWith features such as group discussions, live events, and member profiles, Skool provides a more interactive and personalized experience for community members than Patreon’s more transactional approach.\n\nPatreon can be good if you are starting out; however, the platform charges you 8% plus fees. As you gain more subscribers and depending on how much you charge, that 8% quickly adds up. With Skool, however, it is a flat $99 monthly, no matter how many subscribers you have.\n\nAll up, the user experience of Skool is way better than Patreon, with the ability to organize online courses that Patreon doesn’t offer.\n\nSkool’s Generous Affiliate Program\n----------------------------------\n\nAs if [Skool](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=b7203ac5662041df9d61a4cc215d8609) couldn’t get any better, the icing on the cake is Skool’s affiliate program. Sam Ovens believes in the power of word-of-mouth marketing and wants to reward those who share Skool with others. Community leaders can earn a generous 40% recurring commission through their affiliate program for every new member they refer to Skool.\n\nThis is a great way to generate passive income and allows community leaders to expand their network and impact even more people by introducing them to the valuable educational resources, community-building tools, and support offered through Skool.\n\nIf you don’t have your own Skool community but are a member of a group hosted on Skool, i.e., you have a profile; you also get your own referral link.\n\n### Use My Referral Link, and I Will Personally Help You Build Your Skool Community for Free\n\nAre you considering joining Skool but unsure how to start building your own network?

As an artist myself, I struggled to find the right platform to share my knowledge and skills with others. That’s when I stumbled upon Skool and everything changed for me.\n\nThe first thing that caught my attention was the interactive features offered by Skool. With group discussions, live events, and member profiles, it felt like a real community where people could connect and learn from each other. This was something that Patreon, which I had been using before, lacked.\n\nI have been able to organize all of my painting tutorial videos into categories, for example, Landscapes, [Seascapes](https://samuelearp.com/blog/how-to-paint-a-dramatic-seascape-in-5-easy-steps/), Mountains, etc. I host weekly Zoom meetings for Q&As, painting critiques, and painting livestreams.\n\nThe community section is buzzing with discussions and tips on various painting techniques, [art supplies](https://samuelearp.com/blog/best-oil-paints/), and even marketing strategies for artists. It’s amazing to see how supportive and knowledgeable the community members alike are, always willing to share their experiences and help each other grow.\n\nThe Skool Games\n---------------\n\n![Image 9](https://samuelearp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-15.34.38-2-1024x609.jpeg)\n\nIn January 2024, the entrepreneur Alex Hormozi, founder of GymLaunch and [Acquisition.com](http://acquisition.com/), partnered with Sam Ovens to create The Skool Games.\n\nThe Skool Games is a fun opportunity for entrepreneurs to win coaching from Alex Hormozi in a monthly competition. It makes growing your online community a fun challenge and a great way to network with other entrepreneurs.\n\nConclusion: Skool – The Ultimate Community and Learning Platform For Creators\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSkool is not just a learning platform; it is a community for entrepreneurs and creators to come together, learn from each other, and grow their businesses. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced entrepreneur, Skool offers valuable resources, a support team, and opportunities to help you reach your goals. So why wait?

It is a dynamic space where you can create courses, foster discussions, and build a community of like-minded people.\n\nSkool Pros & Cons\n-----------------\n\nWhen considering an online community platform, it’s essential to weigh its pros and cons against your specific needs and preferences to make the right decision.\n\n### Pros\n\n*   Enhanced Learning Through Collaboration\n*   Create Content for Client Growth\n*   A Streamlined, User-Friendly Interface\n\n### Cons\n\n*   Limited Customization Options\n*   Requires Consistent Engagement\n*   Subscription Model\n\n### Skool Pros\n\n*   **Enhanced Learning Through Collaboration:** Skool transforms the learning experience of your customers.

The design is intuitive, making it easy for your customers to find what they need without unnecessary complexity. This simplicity means they spend less time figuring out the platform and more time engaging with the content and community.\n\n### Skool Cons\n\n*   **Limited Customization Options:** While Skool offers a seamless interface, the customization options are limited. This isn’t a significant issue, as the existing layout is well-designed, but if you enjoy personalizing your online spaces extensively, this might be a minor drawback.\n*   **Requires Consistent Engagement:** Regular participation is key to fully benefiting from Skool. This isn’t a downside but more of you being engaged in your community for it to stay active. Your community will get the most out of the Skool platform by consistently staying plugged in with them and updating your course material.\n*   **Subscription Model:** Skool operates on a subscription basis, which might be a consideration for those mindful of ongoing expenses. However, the value gained from the platform’s resources and community features is well worth it, especially with solid revenue coming in. \n\nQuick Verdict – Is Skool Worth the Money?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAfter spending countless hours as both a user and community member on Skool, it is definitely worth trying out!\n\nSkool offers an enriching, flexible, and interactive learning experience that’s hard to find elsewhere.

However, if you make engagement and updates a habit, this becomes less of an issue.\\\\\n\nSo, if you’re looking for a platform that offers more than just a platform for creators if you’re seeking a place for your people to grow, learn, and connect with like-minded individuals, Skool is undoubtedly worth it!\n\nTake the leap and invest in your community and content today with Skool!\n\nWho is Skool for?\n-----------------\n\n[![Image 2: You’ll love Skool if:](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/0c765ada43744c6aa54b334e5c248206)](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=c39ce8de3c534b36983aeb172e9d5305)\n\n### You’ll love Skool if:\n\n*   **You’re a community builder passionate about creating meaningful connections.** Skool provides online tools similar to Facebook groups to make that happen effortlessly.\n*   **You’re an educator or mentor looking to create an interactive learning environment.** Skool’s features are tailor-made to foster engagement and boost learning outcomes for your students or members.\n*   **You’re an entrepreneur seeking to build a robust online presence for your brand**.

While Skool is user-friendly, it does require a basic level of comfort with digital platforms.\n*   **You’re looking for a quick fix or instantaneous results for your community**. Having an ultimate community-building platform takes time and effort, and while Skool can facilitate the process, it can’t bypass the need for patience and persistence.\n\nWhat is Skool?\n--------------\n\nSkool is an innovative online community platform that provides interactive learning and networking. It is a dynamic space where you can create courses, foster discussions, and build a community of like-minded people.\n\nThis platform merges social networking and online education, creating a unique personal and professional growth environment.\n\n### What is the key benefit of having Skool?\n\nThe key benefit of Skool lies in helping you create a community-centered approach to learning. Unlike traditional online community management platforms, Skool emphasizes interaction and collaboration, making it more than just a place to provide educational content.\n\nIt’s where you can share insights, get feedback, and build relationships with your community that shares your interests and goals.\n\n### How does Skool work?\n\nSkool operates by helping you combine structured learning with social interaction. Once you join, you create your own community that offers various courses, live sessions, and discussion forums.\n\nThe intuitive platform allows you to create and share courses easily, foster community discussions, and track your student’s learning progress. It also offers tools for creating study groups and facilitating peer-to-peer learning and networking. For help getting started, enter the [Skool Games](https://theprocesshacker.com/blog/skool-games/)!\n\n### How is it different from competitors?\n\nSkool’s strong emphasis on community building and real-time interaction sets it apart from other online learning platforms. While most e-learning platforms focus primarily on content delivery, Skool creates a more engaging and social learning experience.\n\nSkool blurs the line between education and networking, offering a space that educates and connects you with a network of peers and professionals. This aspect makes learning in Skool a more holistic and interactive experience, starkly contrasting to the more solitary learning journeys found on traditional platforms.\n\nReasons I Recommend Skool to Everyone\n-------------------------------------\n\n[![Image 3: Reasons I Recommend Skool to Everyone](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/0c765ada43744c6aa54b334e5c248206)](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=c39ce8de3c534b36983aeb172e9d5305)\n\nThe first thing that amazed me about Skool is the incredibly engaging learning experience that you can provide or get from other communities. Unlike traditional online courses where students passively watch videos, Skool brings each topic to life through interactive discussions and collaborative projects. You’re not just a creator or learner here; everyone is an active participant in your their own success.\n\nThe benefit for you and your community is a deeper understanding and retention of knowledge. I noticed this when I built a course for business operations and when I was part of a blogging community. Instead of merely watching lectures, we discussed strategies and applied concepts in real-time projects.\n\nThe hands-on approach solidified learning and made it enjoyable. This is a stark contrast to the forgettable, passive learning on other platforms.\n\n### #2) Community Support and Networking\n\nAnother aspect of Skool that I found incredibly valuable is the community support and networking opportunities. The platform allows you to foster and join communities with enthusiastic learners and experts from various fields, so you’re always a message away from advice, feedback, or a new perspective.\n\nFor you, this translates to an enriched learning environment where anyone can learn not just from courses but also from other members with diverse experiences and skills.\n\nIn my blogging course, I connected with a mentor through Skool who guided me through doing cold outreach, something I hadn’t experienced with other online learning tools. It’s more than an educational platform; it’s your own professional network that keeps giving.\n\n### #3) Customizable Learning Path\n\nFinally, Skool’s customizable learning path is incredible. You and your students are not confined to predetermined courses or linear paths; everyone can tailor their learning experience to suit their own personal and professional goals.\n\nThe benefit here is the flexibility and relevance of each person’s learning journey. You choose what you learn and at what pace.\n\nWhile exploring blogging topics, I could focus on specific tactics and software relevant to my business projects. This level of customization ensures that my and my student’s time at Skool was always productive and aligned with our objectives.\n\nIt’s a personalization that I haven’t found in many other online learning platforms.\n\nWhat You Might Not Like About Skool\n-----------------------------------\n\n### #1) Overwhelming Content and Discussions\n\nOne aspect of Skool that you may find challenging is the sheer volume of content and discussions that are possible. Initially, I was excited about fostering community with courses and topics. However, you may find yourself sifting through many discussions and getting overwhelmed by the many notifications.\n\nFor you, this can mean spending extra time navigating through the platform to find the right threads. While the conversations are a plus, they can also lead to information overload, especially if you and your students prefer a more streamlined, focused approach to learning.\n\nI found myself spending more time than I anticipated just keeping up with the latest posts and community updates, which, at times, can detract from the community.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the variable quality of community contributions. Skool thrives on user-generated content and discussions, but this also means the quality of your communities can be inconsistent. In my experience, while many discussions were insightful, others lacked depth or were off-topic.\n\nThis variability could affect you and your students’ learning experience, as you might need to spend time discerning valuable insights from less informative contributions. Unlike platforms with strictly curated content, Skool requires you to evaluate the information and opinions shared within its community more proactively.\n\nWhile this platform aspect fosters a dynamic and open environment, so your students are relying on your students to provide vetted content in the courses.\n\nSkool Pricing\n-------------\n\nSkool offers a straightforward and transparent pricing model: $99 per month for a comprehensive package. This single plan includes everything – unlimited courses, groups, and Skool community members, with no hidden fees.\n\nYou can start with a 14-day free trial to explore its features, and there’s a modest 2.9% transaction fee. The simplicity of this pricing structure makes it an accessible and hassle-free choice for anyone looking to join an online learning community.\n\nSkool: Key Features Breakdown\n-----------------------------\n\n[![Image 4: Skool: Key Features Breakdown](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/0c765ada43744c6aa54b334e5c248206)](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=c39ce8de3c534b36983aeb172e9d5305)\n\n### Interactive Courses\n\n[![Image 5: Skool: Interactive Courses](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=c39ce8de3c534b36983aeb172e9d5305)\n\nInteractive Courses allow you to blend native video hosting of lectures, hands-on projects, and real-time discussions for your community. Unlike the one-way communication in traditional online courses, Skool helps you design courses to be dynamic and engaging. You’ll find your students not just watching content but actively participating in it – from interactive exercises to group projects.\n\nWhat sets these courses apart is their emphasis on active learning. Your students are not just passively consuming information; they are applying it, discussing it with peers, and getting instant feedback.\n\nThis approach ensures your people get a deep understanding and a more memorable learning experience. It’s a refreshing change from the usual online course format, bringing the dynamics of a classroom environment into the digital space.\n\nThe interactive courses transformed my approach to online course creation and learning. During a course on blogging and SEO, I wasn’t just learning SEO; I was actively blogging, sharing progress with peers, and getting real-time feedback from coaches. This course experience not only solidified my understanding but also made learning more enjoyable and engaging.\n\nOn the flip side, I have also built courses on business operations, in which I have seen transformations. What I teach can seem boring, but with Skool, I produced an interactive course with engaging videos and quizzes, making the learning experience more dynamic and enjoyable for my students.\n\n[![Image 6: Community Discussions with Skool](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=c39ce8de3c534b36983aeb172e9d5305)\n\nCommunity Discussions are vibrant forums where your learners engage in meaningful conversations about various topics. These discussions go beyond simple Q&A; they’re dynamic, involving debates, shared experiences, and collaborative problem-solving. You can create and find threads on various subjects, from specific course content to broader industry trends.\n\nUnlike the often superficial interactions on typical online forums, [Skool’s community](https://theprocesshacker.com/blog/skool-community/) discussions help you provide rich insights and expertise to your community.\n\nYou’re not just reading comments but helping create ongoing conversations that deepen your students’ understanding and perspectives. This interactive environment fosters a sense of belonging and dramatically enhances the learning experience for everyone.\n\nDuring my SEO course, I found myself deeply involved in a discussion about the latest trends in using AI to write blog posts. The insights I gained from that conversation were invaluable, going far beyond what I’d learned from the course materials alone. This feature has not only enriched my blogging and SEO knowledge but has also connected me with a network of individuals who are passionate about the same things as me.\n\nIn my own community, I set up and facilitated forums for automating your business, the best tools for project management, and the best metrics to use for your business. I saw transformations taking place as people could take the next step in their business!\n\n### Networking Opportunities\n\n[![Image 7: Networking Opportunities with Skool](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=c39ce8de3c534b36983aeb172e9d5305)\n\nSkool is not just a platform for learning; it’s also a hub for networking. It provides ample opportunities for your members to connect, collaborate, and build relationships with each other.\n\nWhat makes this feature special is its emphasis on community building. Skool understands that learning is not a solitary endeavor but a social one. The platform fosters an environment where you can facilitate and engage in meaningful conversations, share ideas, and learn from each other’s experiences.\n\nIn communities I have joined and created, I’ve connected with like-minded individuals, learned from their insights, and even collaborated on joint partnerships and social media. It’s not just about growing your professional network but also about building meaningful relationships that enrich your business and learning journey.\n\n### Customizable Learning Paths\n\n[![Image 8: Customizable Learning Paths with Skool](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=c39ce8de3c534b36983aeb172e9d5305)\n\nUnlike rigid, one-size-fits-all course structures, Skool allows you to customize courses, modules, and interactive sessions for your community. This means you can design a learning path that aligns perfectly with what your students are passionate about or what skills they want to develop.\n\nWhat makes this feature stand out is its user-centric approach to education. After creating the content, your students are in control of their learning. Whether they’re diving deep into a particular subject or exploring a range of diverse topics, Skool adapts to their pace and preferences.\n\nAs someone with varied business needs, I understood the importance of having multiple modules to meet my clients where they are in their business. There are many paths to optimizing and systemizing a business, and so my clients appreciated the customizable approach to learning. Some clients choose to focus on organizing their business using systems, while others need to hire a virtual assistant desperately.\n\nFurther, in my blogging and SEO course, this level of customization made learning more relevant and enjoyable and empowered me to learn the skills that I needed at the moment. I choose to first walk through the entire course and then deep dive into keyword research, hiring, and backlink outreach, one at a time.\n\n### Resource Library\n\n[![Image 9: Resource Library with Skool](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=c39ce8de3c534b36983aeb172e9d5305)\n\nThe Resource Library helps you create a repository of various learning materials, from course readings and lecture notes to webinars and videos. The library is organized to make it easy for you and your students to find the resources you need.\n\nSkool’s Resource Library helps you carefully curate the course and community resources to ensure they are relevant and valuable to your students’ learning journey. Moreover, these [Skool resources](https://theprocesshacker.com/blog/skool-hacks/) are easily accessible, allowing everyone to learn anytime, anywhere.\n\nIn my course or other courses, when we wanted to deepen our understanding of a particular course topic, the library was there for additional materials. This feature has not only enriched the learning experience but also saved me and others countless hours we would have otherwise spent searching for resources elsewhere.\n\n### Feedback and Assessment\n\n[![Image 10: Feedback and Assessment with Skool](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=c39ce8de3c534b36983aeb172e9d5305)\n\nFeedback and Assessment help you provide constructive feedback and evaluate the learning progress of your students. This system includes peer reviews, instructor feedback, and self-assessment tools. Whether they are completing a project, participating in a discussion, or submitting an assignment, you can provide timely and relevant feedback that helps your community members gauge their understanding and areas for improvement.\n\nUnlike traditional platforms where feedback can be limited or one-sided, Skool encourages a multi-dimensional feedback process. Your people will get insights from coaches and peers, which adds diverse perspectives to their learning. This comprehensive feedback system ensures a well-rounded understanding and helps identify specific areas to focus on for improvement.\n\nThis not only helped me refine my course material but also helped my students deepen their understanding of the subject matter. The constructive criticism and encouragement that members have received have been excellent for business growth.\n\n### Mobile Accessibility\n\n[![Image 11: Mobile Accessibility with Skool](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)](https://www.skool.com/refer?ref=c39ce8de3c534b36983aeb172e9d5305)\n\nThe Skool mobile app gives you access to all the platform’s resources and features from your mobile device. Whether using an iPhone or an Android device, you and your students can learn on the go with Skool’s mobile-friendly design.\n\nThis community feature stands out because it makes learning incredibly convenient. You’re not tied to a desktop or laptop; you can learn whenever you want, wherever you are. This flexibility means you can maximize your time, fitting in learning around your other commitments.\n\nI often found myself revising course materials on my commute or listening to webinars while doing household chores. Learning seamlessly blended into my work routine, making it less of a chore and more of a joy. And learning on the go has undoubtedly helped me stay consistent with my learning goals.\n\nFAQs about Skool\n----------------\n\n### Does Skool offer analytics and payment processing?\n\nYes, Skool provides detailed analytics to track course performance and student progress. It also has a seamless payment processing system, allowing you to set up your [pricing structure](https://theprocesshacker.com/blog/skool-pricing/) while Skool handles the payments.\n\n### Are there any additional tools needed with Skool?\n\nWhile Skool covers many aspects of the online course platform market and online community management, you might still need additional tools like a website/funnel builder and an email marketing system. Skool has a Zapier integration, which can help connect to various CRMs.\n\n### Can I earn from Skool?\n\nYes, many people earn full-time incomes by building and managing their online communities on Skool. The platform supports various monetization methods, including paid memberships and course sales.\n\n### What kind of support team and resources does Skool provide?\n\nSkool offers a range of support options, including the [Skool Games](https://theprocesshacker.com/blog/skool-games/), email support, and searchable help documentation. Additionally, there’s a Skool Community for more product discussions. Educational resources available include online courses, subscription memberships, group funnels better than a Facebook group, coaching programs, and support forums.\n\n### What is Skool’s approach to privacy and terms of use?\n\nSkool has a Privacy Policy that outlines how user data is collected, used, and shared. They also have a Terms of Use document governing the use of their platform. It’s important for users to be aware of these documents as they sign up and use Skool’s services.\n\nFinal Verdict – to Buy Skool or Not to Buy Skool?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSkool: Best Online Community Platform?\n\n![Image 12](blob:https://theprocesshacker.com/34a963c33717ad6441a86916ff7caaa0)\n\nSkool is an innovative online community platform that provides interactive learning and networking. It is a dynamic space where you can create courses, foster discussions, and build a community of like-minded people.\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring Skool’s features and personally experiencing its potential, I believe Skool is the ultimate online community platform!\n\nThe community-building potential and the opportunity to create excellent content are just a few of the standout features that make Skool an excellent choice.\n\nThe proof lies in the details. Skool’s incredible features which bring a unique dynamic to online learning, allowing you to not only create amazing content but also contribute your own insights. The mobile accessibility ensures your students can fit learning into your daily routine, making it convenient and flexible.\n\nI understand there may be reservations. Perhaps you’re unsure about the quality of the Skool community building or the variety of resources available. However, my personal experience is that Skool provides a vast range of resources, which enables you to cater to different learning styles and interests.\n\nSo, if you’re an entrepreneur, coach, influencer, or creator looking for a comprehensive platform to build a community and share knowledge, Skool is definitely worth considering.\n\nTake the plunge and discover the benefits of Skool today!\n\nNext up in this Skool review, let’s explore some alternatives to the app in case you’re still undecided or want to compare options. Stay tuned!\n\nSkool Alternatives\n------------------\n\nIf $99 is too much for you to stomach or if you need a different solution, you might like one of these [Skool alternatives](https://theprocesshacker.com/blog/skool-alternatives/).\n\n### #1) Teachable\n\nTeachable contrasts with Skool in its focus and functionality. While Skool integrates community building with learning, Teachable specializes in creating and selling online courses.\n\nIt’s a platform tailored for those prioritizing course creation and distribution over community interaction. Teachable’s built-in email marketing and integrated payment processing make it a more streamlined platform for creators looking to market and monetize their content directly.\n\nHowever, it lacks Skool’s robust community features, making Teachable less ideal if fostering a learning community is your primary goal. Teachable’s suitability lies more with individual educators or small businesses focused on delivering structured online courses rather than those seeking an integrated community and learning experience​\n\n### #2) Mighty Networks\n\nMighty Networks is another alternative that offers a slightly different approach than Skool. It is more akin to a traditional community platform, offering robust features for community engagement and interaction among community members.\n\nThis platform creates a sense of community and belonging, with options for building courses and facilitating group discussions. Where Skool emphasizes the educational aspect with its course-centric approach, Mighty Networks leans more towards fostering connections and discussions within its community.\n\nThis makes Mighty Networks an excellent fit for those who prioritize community building and engagement, possibly at the expense of a more structured learning experience​\n\n### #3) Kajabi\n\nKajabi, in contrast to Skool, is an all-in-one platform that combines course creation, marketing, and sales tools. It focuses on providing a comprehensive suite for digital entrepreneurs and educators who want to create, market, and sell their courses.\n\nWhile Kajabi offers community features, its strength lies in its marketing and sales capabilities, making it a superior choice for those looking to build a business around their courses.\n\nHowever, for those seeking a platform primarily for community-driven learning experiences, Skool still holds an edge due to its focus on interactive and community-based learning. Kajabi is best suited for users who need robust tools for course creation, marketing, and sales rather than just a platform for video hosting and learning online communities​.\n\n### #4) Circle\n\nCircle is an innovative way to communicate with your community. It’s different from Skool in that it emphasizes communication and collaboration in a secure and private environment. Skool may offer similar functionalities, but Circle offers unique features designed specifically for community engagement.\n\nWith Circle, you can create interest-based groups, share content, and even host events. It’s a robust platform that’s easy to use and offers a powerful suite of tools for community organizers. Whether you’re a business professional or a casual user, Circle is the perfect way to engage with your community on a new level.",

It’s tailored for educators and creators seeking to foster a vibrant, interactive learning experience for their students.\n\nBut does it have all that you need as a content creator to seamlessly grow your business? In other words, is it worthwhile for course creators like you?\n\nAfter hearing all the hype about it, I had to test it out myself. See all of my thoughts in this in-depth Skool review.\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\nWhat is Skool?\n--------------\n\n[Skool](https://todaytesting.com/go/skool) is a community platform started by serial entrepreneur Sam Owens in 2019. It is designed to keep everything in one place, so you can better manage your offerings.\n\nWith Skool, you can do the following:\n\n*   Host online course content.\n*   Create membership sites and manage your subscriptions and members.\n*   Create funnels.\n*   Set up communities.\n*   Create specialized premium content for an additional fee.\n*   Offer group and personalized coaching programs.\n*   Gather feedback from users.\n\nAs you can see, it’s a one-stop place for all your content and provides multiple ways to interact with your customers and make money. This is not a surprise given that this tool was created to fill the gaps that exist in many of the other platforms.\n\nThat said, is it ideal for you?\n\nLet’s explore each of its features to help you make an informed decision.\n\nOnline Course Creation\n----------------------\n\nCreating your courses and uploading your content is simple and intuitive on Skool. All you have to do is navigate to the Classroom feature, give a name to your course, and start adding static content. It’s one of the easiest systems I’ve used.\n\nI found that the user interface is very straightforward and self-explanatory.\n\n![Image 3](blob:https://todaytesting.com/8c536dbcf127642f750a66100a04bb88)\n\nYou can create different sets and modules to make your content more meaningful and understandable for your audiences. Every module can take links, files, and a description of what to expect from it. You can even include action items and transcripts in it.\n\nOnce your students take the course, you can monitor the completion rate of each module to better understand what types of media are most preferred by your students.\n\nHowever, I have to point out that at the time of writing this piece, native video hosting is not supported by Skool yet. You’ll have to upload your videos on YouTube, Vimeo, and other platforms, and only add the link to your module. This is a bit of a drawback, but not a deal breaker.\n\nAlso, you can’t change the look and feel too much and all courses will have the same layout and design. The good news though is that the design is modern and attractive.\n\nAnother aspect to note is that you can’t add quizzes and assessments directly to your course. You may have to rely on third-party integrations if you want to include this in your course.\n\nCommunity\n---------\n\nCommunity is one of the central features of Skool, and in my opinion, this is where the platform really shines. The interface is similar to Facebook where every member can view their feeds and know what’s happening across their communities.\n\nAs a content creator and admin of a community, you have complete control over the group posts and events. You can even choose to make the posts admin-only, so only you can post and others can merely interact with your posts.\n\nThe posts can be text, GIFs, videos, polls, and more depending on your audience’s preferences.\n\nThis community feature is helpful for users too, as they can categorize posts, and focus on the topics that interest them. Such personalization can bring more people to this site, which in turn, can increase your community and revenue prospects as well.\n\nGamification\n------------\n\nAnother highlight of Skool is the gamification option.\n\nWhen many users interact with the content you post, you earn a certain number of points. In this sense, you get incentivized for your efforts with points. As you earn more points, you move on to higher levels, and this is displayed on your profile.\n\nFrom a monetization standpoint, these levels add credibility to your offerings, and more users are likely to trust those who are at the higher levels. You can also invite specific users to your community through the internal messaging system.\n\nFrom another angle, you can reward the members who have the highest points as it signifies their high level of interactions within your community. Such incentivization can motivate more people to stay engaged within your community.\n\nAll these options together make this platform exciting and can enthuse more people to regularly post and interact.\n\nCalendar\n--------\n\nOne of the pain points as a content creator is the task of regularly reminding people of your upcoming events. At the same time, these reminders are also important given that people may forget.\n\nFor this, Skool has a convenient feature called Calendar.\n\nWhen members sign up for an event or even a personalized coaching session, the calendar feature automatically converts to their local timezone and reminds them.\n\nAdditionally, this feature also displays a personal calendar for you and reminds you of upcoming events, similar to a Google Calendar app.\n\nFunnels\n-------\n\nSkool offers a different kind of funnel that can be rewarding for content creators like you. The typical way we go about it as course creators is to send a prospect to a landing page, and then guide them to purchase your product and service through the web page, so they eventually become your customer.\n\nSkool is more straightforward, and honestly, I like it. Instead of a landing page, you send your prospects directly to your community. Additionally, you can offer online courses or share group events through the community to make it a rewarding experience for your customers.\n\nIn a way, Skool removes the need for landing pages and makes your funnels more efficient. You can visualize it as a Facebook community but with a higher engagement rate and customization options.\n\nBesides acting as a reminder for those who have signed up for group events, it also displays your events and schedules, so you can stay on top of them as well.\n\nAdditional Features\n-------------------\n\nBesides the above main features, there are some other aspects I have to point out that make Skool highly useful for both you and your audience. Here’s a brief look at each of them.\n\n### Mobile App\n\nA mobile app is something that most content creation platforms offer today, and Skool follows the pack. But, the difference is that it is well-developed and is as intuitive as using the desktop. Your community members can use this app to send direct messages to other members, view courses, attend events, participate in group discussions, create and interact with posts, and more.\n\nHowever, this is not a branded app, which means, your followers will have to download the Skool app and find the communities that they are a part of.\n\n### Search\n\nYou can search through posts, courses, discussions, and comments to find all the relevant content. You can also use regular expressions, wildcards, and more to precisely find what you want.\n\n### Integrations\n\nWhen compared to other content creation tools, the integrations at Skool are a bit limited in my opinion. It integrates with Zapier through which you can connect to other apps. But you’ll have to pay an additional fee to Zapier.\n\nBesides Zapier, you can use WordPress plugins to directly integrate with your blog or website.\n\n### Live Messaging\n\nSkool offers live messaging and this can be a huge addition for content creators. Do you know that [79% of businesses](https://www.ltvplus.com/live-chat/live-chat-statistics-insights-to-help-you-succeed-in-2020/) offering live chat have seen an increase in sales and customer loyalty? Also, real-time chat increases conversions by 12%.\n\nWith Skool’s real-time chats, you too can gain these benefits. Moreover, you can discuss your offerings with a prospect or a community member, answer any queries and concerns, share insights, collaborate, get feedback, and more.\n\n### Single Dashboard\n\nAnother excellent aspect is a simplified dashboard where you can see all the metrics that matter, including numbers for growth, engagement, and progress. You can view these numbers at the member or group level.\n\nThe dashboard is intuitive and it’s easy to find what you want. You can even view progress in the form of graphs to quickly understand the progress you’re making over time.\n\n### Complete Control\n\nWith Skool, you have complete control over how you want to handle your notifications, chats, and preferences. For example, you can choose to have email digests mailed once a day to get a comprehensive idea of all the popular posts that were published. Similarly, you can choose to get notifications via your app or email.\n\n### Email Broadcasts\n\nYou can use Skool to send email broadcasts to all your contacts with a single click. All that you have to do is create a post and send it to all the members of your community. While there are no features like tagging or segmentation, the simplicity of sending the broadcast emails appeals to some creators.\n\n### Automatic Affiliates\n\nThis is an interesting feature in Skool. If any member in your community decides to create his or her own community, Skool will pay you 40% of their monthly subscription. The advantage of this option is that you can make Skool a revenue stream instead of an expense. In other words, you can create a thriving community, encourage many people to create Skool communities and earn a steady income for yourself.\n\n### Customer Support\n\nLastly, the customer support is excellent. Though there’s no live chat option, the email support is prompt. Moreover, there’s a well-developed knowledge base that has answers to most questions. Lastly, the thriving community at Skool provides valuable insights and peer support.\n\nOverall, these features add value to your offerings. It supports your business and helps you interact with more people to eventually make them your loyal customers. The best part is that all this happens through a clean user interface, making it an enjoyable process for you.\n\nDue to these reasons, Skool has quickly become a popular option to interact with your followers, share more meaningful content, and increase your growth and profitability.\n\nDownsides\n---------\n\nDespite the above advantage, it merits to note that Skool is not perfect and doesn’t cover every aspect of an online content business. Notably, it doesn’t have an email marketing functionality at all.\n\nPrimarily, it’s not a standalone tool for course creation, membership sites, and funnels. Rather, what makes this unique is its ability to combine all of these modules through a community feature that can be rewarding for you and your audiences.\n\nPricing\n-------\n\n[Skool pricing](https://todaytesting.com/skool-pricing/) is $99 per month to host a single community. There are no bundling options available at the time of writing this piece, which means, that if you choose to have five communities, you will have to pay 5 X $99 per month. But the good part is there’s no limit on the number of members and the courses they can access.\n\n[Skool offers a 14-day free trial](https://todaytesting.com/go/skool). You can use this period to evaluate if this tool is a good fit for your needs.\n\nOverall Verdict - Is Skool For You?\n-----------------------------------\n\nAt first glance, it may seem like Skool doesn’t have all the features needed for a comprehensive [course creation tool](https://todaytesting.com/best-online-course-platforms/) as it doesn’t support native [video](https://todaytesting.com/online-video-course/) uploads, no email marketing, and no support for [quizzes](https://todaytesting.com/best-online-quiz-maker-software/) and assessments.\n\nBut remember, Skool isn’t just a course creation tool, rather it is a single place to house all your online content, where you can have courses, membership sites, coaching sessions, and stay on top of it all with a vibrant community. With a good strategy, your community members will become your brand ambassadors.\n\nDue to this integrated nature, I think Skool is worthwhile if you want to:\n\n*   Create multiple content monetization streams.\n*   Have a centralized place to store all your online content\n*   Understand your customers’ preferences better.\n*   Build a vibrant community for your offerings.\n*   Send automatic reminders to your members for group events and other programs.\n*   Incentivize engagement through gamification.\n*   Chat with members\n*   Offer one-on-one coaching sessions.\n*   Monitor the health of your offerings through a single dashboard.\n\nOverall, Skool is a good place for content creators who want everything in one place and place audience interaction and engagement as the central aspect of their content business.\n\n_**Have any questions about this Skool review?
