## Comprehensive Evaluation of Skool.com
This is a comprehensive evaluation of Skool.com, focusing primarily on Skool reviews from various users and the platform's key features.

Skool serves as a platform for creators to build and manage communities.

If these aspects appeal to you:

- Consolidate your courses, community, and event scheduling on a single, streamlined platform
- Provide your community members with an ad-free, distraction-free environment
- Implement gamification to incentivize active participation and value contribution
- Encourage daily logins, member actions, and a sense of accountability
- Foster community engagement with minimal effort on your part

Then [Skool](https://www.skool.com/discovery?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb) could be the ideal solution for your needs.

## The Most Compelling Aspect?

I've personally managed my own <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a> as a business owner for the past year, while also participating as a member in several other groups. Consequently, these Skool reviews will explore the experience of both running your own <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a> and being a participant in someone else's.

Let's begin our in-depth analysis.

## What Exactly is Skool?
Skool enables you to integrate your course content, community, and event calendar into a single, cohesive platform. By offering an intuitive all-in-one solution, it eliminates the need for separate tools like Kajabi or Teachable for course management, and MightNetworks, Circle, or Facebook Groups for community engagement.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool dashboard](/skool-dashboard.png)</a>


Co-founded by Sam Ovens, the platform initiated with a closed beta in 2019 and became publicly accessible in early 2022. With consistent feature updates and an expanding user base, one thing is certain:

**Skool is here for the long haul.**

## Who Can Benefit from Skool?

If you identify as a:

- Business proprietor
- Coach or consultant
- Educator
- Course creator
- YouTube content producer

And your goal is to instruct or assemble individuals into a unified, distraction-free, and advertisement-free community where you maintain complete control over all content visibility, then Skool might be the perfect fit for your needs.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/discovery?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool</a> could be the perfect fit for you.


## Let's Dissect and Evaluate the Skool Platform Feature by Feature

Skool's platform is built around four core features. Let's explore each of these in detail.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/community/the-key-to-community-10-true-regulars?p=9cecb094&ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool hot tip](/skool-hot-tip.png)</a>

### Skool's 4 Core Features

A <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a> comprises four primary features:

1. **Community**
2. **Classroom**
3. **Calendar**
4. **Gamification**

#### Community

Within the ***community***, members can interact through posts, likes, comments, and direct messaging:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool community](/skool-community-v2.png)</a>

#### Classroom

In the ***classroom***, your customers can access and progress through your courses and training programs:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool classroom](/skool-classroom.png)</a>

#### Calendar

Via the ***calendar***, you can organize online and offline events such as recurring calls, webinars, and meetups for yourself and your members. For instance, if you join the Skool Games, there's a weekly Q&A session where participants can ask questions directly to Alex Hormozi, and he responds to these inquiries during this dedicated time slot.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool calendar](/skool-calendar.png)</a>

#### Gamification

***Gamification*** rewards members with points for each 'like' their posts or comments receive. Accumulating a certain number of points results in 'leveling up'. Rewards can be associated with each level to boost engagement. Leaderboards showcase the most active members and rewards for each level:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool gamification](/skool-gamification.png)</a>

### The Community Section of a <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool Group</a> Appears as Follows:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool games community feed](/skool-community-skool-games-feed.png)</a>

It features a clean interface where users can primarily perform two actions:

1. Create their own posts.
2. Peruse and engage with posts from other members.

(We'll delve into the various post types available in a Skool community later)

For comparison, here's a typical Facebook group interface:

![facebook group](/facebook-group.png)

While they share similarities in terms of posting and engagement capabilities, the Facebook experience can be overwhelming. Accessing Facebook and navigating to your group often feels like maneuvering through a bustling shopping district. There's a constant barrage of distractions vying for your attention.

In contrast, logging into Skool transports you to a serene digital oasis.

Throughout my year-long experience, I’ve consistently found it pleasurable to spend time in a Skool community, both as a member and as an administrator.

### Posting in a Skool Community

Both regular members and administrators can create posts in a <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool community</a>. Posts can include file attachments, images, GIFs, and videos (from YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, Wistia, or Bunny.net). There's also an option to conduct polls.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![create skool post](/create-skool-post.png)</a>


When creating a post, you assign it to a specific category. This categorization helps maintain organization. Members can easily filter posts by category using a pill menu and employ the filter button to sort posts, facilitating quick access to specific information:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool filter post](/skool-sort-filter.png)</a>


As an administrator, you have the flexibility to establish categories as you see fit. You can even create categories where only administrators can post, while members are limited to viewing content.

### User Profiles, Chat Functionality, and Notifications

Each community member has a public profile page:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool profile](/skool-profile.png)</a>


A profile page displays:

- The individual's community activity, including their posts and comments on others' content
- Groups created by the user (can be hidden at the group level)
- Groups they're a member of (can be hidden at the group level)

Follow someone to receive notifications whenever they post. Additionally, you can initiate one-on-one chats (group chat functionality is currently unavailable).

You can always access your chats and notifications via the top right corner of the screen:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool notification](/skool-notification.png)</a>

### Skool Community Feature - Summary

Skool delivers on the essential elements required to <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">cultivate a thriving community</a>. For members, it provides a supportive, distraction-free environment where they can engage and connect with peers, feel accountable, and consistently work towards shared goals and specific rewards.

The chat feature allows members to privately connect with each other and administrators to discuss particular topics and exchange knowledge, further facilitating relationship building. Moreover, the "time to value" is remarkably swift. Upon joining a new community, the learning curve is approximately 3 seconds.

For administrators, communities are straightforward to set up, user-friendly, low-maintenance, and importantly, can be made engaging through **gamification** (which we'll explore in feature #4).

## Feature #2 - The Classroom

The classroom is the second primary feature of a <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a>. This is where your members can access and progress through your courses.

It appears as follows:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool classroom](/skool-classroom-v2.png)</a>

If you offer multiple courses, members will first need to select which course they want to view when accessing the classroom tab:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool course selection](/skool-course-selection.png)</a>


You can add an unlimited number of courses to the classroom.

**Note:** If you don't add any courses to your group, the classroom tab will remain hidden.

### Course Setup is Effortless

Setting up a course takes just a few minutes. From the classroom tab, you simply add a new course.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool add course](/skool-add-course.png)</a>


Access to a course can be configured in various ways:

- Open to all members
- Unlocked when members reach a specific level
- Unlocked after a one-time payment
- Unlocked after a set number of days
- Accessible only to selected members

If members unlock the course at a certain level, you determine which level they need to attain for the course to become available in the classroom. (Level attainment is tied to the gamification aspect, which we'll discuss shortly in feature #4.)

Next, you use the intuitive inline/drag-and-drop editor to add and arrange the modules in your course:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool add course module](/skool-create-course-module.png)</a>


Each module can encompass:

- A single video
- Description (with support for linked video timestamps)
- Multiple links
- Multiple file attachments
- Action items
- Transcript (making video content searchable)
- Drip release option to delay access (can be toggled on/off per module)

As of now, Skool doesn't offer video hosting, so you'll need to upload your videos to platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, Loom, or Bunny.net and input the link when setting up a module.

### Skool Classroom Feature - Summary

Once again, Skool excels by providing an aesthetically pleasing course delivery platform through the classroom feature. For members, the classroom serves as an easily accessible space to continue their personal learning journey. The user interface is intuitive, allowing members to navigate effortlessly without any learning curve.

For administrators, course setup is straightforward and quick (typically taking just a few minutes). The interface is so intuitive that you won't need to consult any guides or tutorials.

## Feature #3 - The Calendar

The third core feature of a <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a> is the calendar function, which appears as follows:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool calendar](/skool-calendar.png)</a>


Essentially, it's a public agenda where you can schedule recurring online and offline events for all your members to view.

**Note:** If you don't add any events to your group, the calendar tab will remain hidden until you create an event.

### Scheduling an Event is Intuitive and Similar to Using Google Calendar

Simply input a title and select the date, time, duration, and timezone for your event. You also have the option to send your members an email reminder 24 hours before the scheduled event (which is highly effective in improving attendance rates).

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool create event](/skool-create-event.png)</a>


**Note:** You'll still need a separate tool like Zoom or Google Meet to conduct the actual meeting. Skool doesn't provide this service. The event time is automatically converted to each individual member's timezone, eliminating confusion about time differences!

Members can click on an event to view its description or add it to an external calendar like Google, Apple, Outlook, Outlook.com, or Yahoo:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool event details](/skool-calendar-event.png)</a>

The next upcoming event is also highlighted in the community tab:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool upcoming events](/skool-upcoming-events.png)</a>

Clicking on it takes you directly to the event details - a convenient feature!

**Tip:** If you host Q&A calls, record them and post them in a designated category in the community. This allows your members to revisit the recording whenever they need. You could even go a step further and have your Q&A calls transcribed, making them searchable via Skool's search feature!

### Skool Calendar Feature - Summary

The calendar feature, while simple, adds significant value to the overall Skool experience. For members, it's easy to see upcoming events and access them with just a few clicks. Automatic timezone conversion instantly clarifies when events occur, regardless of a member's location. Forgetting about an event is rare, thanks to the email reminder, add-to-calendar feature, and notification in the community tab.

For administrators, setting up events takes just a few clicks. Expect to receive fewer, possibly even zero, questions about event timing or access. Moreover, attendance rates are boosted effortlessly through email reminders and notifications in the community tab.

## Feature #4 - Gamification

Now, let's explore one of the most engaging features: **gamification**.

When a member posts or comments something valuable, other community members can like that post or comment:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool like post](/skool-like-posts.png)</a>

Likes translate into points which are associated with a level connected to a user's profile.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool post profile](/skool-post-profile.png)</a>


Accumulating a certain number of points results in leveling up (there are 9 levels, which can be customized with your own names). Community members who amass the most points (by contributing the most value to your community) are featured on the leaderboards of your <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a>:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool leaderboard](/skool-gamification.png)</a>

As an administrator, you can link rewards to each specific level. For instance, reaching level 6 in the group shown above unlocks the ability to chat with other members and post in the community tab (this helps prevent spam and low-quality posts).

You can also make classroom content accessible at certain levels. When a member reaches the level you specify, the course automatically becomes available in the classroom tab of the same group. Beyond unlocking classroom content, you have the flexibility to offer virtually any reward you choose. For example, you could offer a free one-on-one coaching call to the top-ranked person on the 30-day leaderboard each month.

### Skool Gamification Feature - Summary

Implementing rewards through gamification is remarkably effective. What better way to foster community engagement (with minimal effort on your part)? Every community member has an incentive to participate and contribute as much value as possible to earn their rewards. The leaderboard tab, displaying points, progress, and comparisons to other members, adds an extra layer of motivation.

The best part? Your community members collectively determine what's most valuable, creating a harmonious balance within your group. Spamming posts to accumulate points isn't a viable strategy.

## Additional Noteworthy Features

Now that we've examined the four primary features of a <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a> and seen a few Skool reviews, let's explore some other notable functionalities:

### Monetize Your Community with Paid Memberships

Skool allows you to charge for membership to your community! Skool replaces the need for a separate landing page, order form, merchant account, and other tools — it handles everything end-to-end, seamlessly. You simply set a price:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool subscription](/skool-subscription.png)</a>

Next, you attract members and voila, you generate revenue!

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool group dashboard](/skool-group-dashboard.png)</a>


Currently, Skool only supports monthly membership fees; one-time payments are not yet available.

### Broadcast Emails About Your Posts (Admin Only)

As an administrator, you have the ability to send email broadcasts to all your <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a> members about your posts (limited to once every 72 hours):

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool post email](/skool-post-email.png)</a>


Here's an example of the email your members would receive:


<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool email result](/skool-email-result.png)</a>

Any images or media included in your post will also appear in the email. The email deliverability is robust; I've never experienced these emails being filtered into spam folders. This feature is excellent for informing your members about updates or promotions without requiring them to log in to view your post.

### Skool's Unified Search Functionality

Skool.com features a single search box that covers ***all posts***, ***comments***, ***course content***, and ***member profiles***. Search results are displayed like this:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool search result](/skool-search-results.png)</a>

You can toggle between different types of search results using the tabs. It's straightforward and effective.

### Chat & Email Notification Preferences

Members can easily manage their chat availability and email notification settings, including the frequency of those notifications:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool email notifications](/skool-notifications-settings.png)</a>

It's possible to adjust the timing of each type of notification or disable them entirely. This is beneficial for members, allowing them to tailor the platform's behavior to their preferences, focusing on their work instead of being inundated with unwanted or too frequent notifications. For administrators, these notifications are valuable for encouraging members to revisit your group.

### Group Analytics (Admin Only)

As an administrator, you have access to useful metrics such as:

- Total member count
- Active member count
- Daily activity levels

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool metrics](/skool-metrics.png)</a>

This helps you gauge your group's performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Public vs Private Skool Groups

When creating your own <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a>, you can choose to make it either public or private:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool public private](/skool-public-private.png)</a>

(You can modify this setting at any time after creating your group.)

A private group means that only members can see the group's participants and content; all information is hidden from search engines. These are ideal for gated content, such as paid courses and masterminds. A public group means anyone can view the group's members and content. The content is indexed and discoverable by search engines. These are effective for managing public communities centered around your brand and products. You can also use them to generate leads, nurture them, and ultimately convert them to your paid group.

**Note:** Before individuals can post or comment in a public group, they must first request access, which an administrator needs to approve.

### Community Members Can Invite Friends

All members can share a link to your group with their contacts:

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool invite friend](/skool-invite-friend.png)</a>

This is a valuable feature if you're planning to run a public group, as it can significantly expand your following without requiring effort on your part.

**Tip:** Pin a 'Welcome & How to Get Started' post in your community and include clear step-by-step instructions on how members can invite friends.

### Ask Up to 3 Questions When People Request to Join Your Group

When someone requests to join your group, you can ask them up to 3 questions.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool membership question](/skool-membership-question.png)</a>

This is useful for gathering additional information about prospective members and can help you decide whether to approve their join request based on their responses. You can ask members up to 3 multiple-choice or open-ended questions. You also have the option to request their email address. Additionally, you can send all answers to your CRM using Skool's Zapier integration.

### Welcome New Members with an Automated DM

Skool allows you to set up an automated direct message that's sent as soon as someone joins your group.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool auto dm](/skool-auto-dm.png)</a>

This is an excellent way to instantly greet new group members and provide instructions on how to get started with your community.

### Skool Mobile App for iOS and Android

Skool offers a mobile app for both iOS and Android devices. Installing the app enables you to receive push notifications about certain posts (depending on your notification settings).

Both apps perform excellently and are notably responsive!

### Skool Pricing Structure

Skool's pricing is as straightforward as the software itself. There's a single plan that includes all features, priced at $99 per month.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">![skool pricing](/skool-pricing.png)</a>

**Note:** This is the price per group. If you want to manage multiple <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool groups</a>, you'll need to pay $99 per month for each group.

<a href="https://www.skool.com/pricing?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool offers a free 14-day trial via this link</a> . Currently, there is no free tier available.

### Skool Discounts & Special Offers

At present, there are no discounts or special offers available for Skool.com. However, if any become available, I'll update this review accordingly. The best offer currently available is the free 14-day trial.

### How to Obtain Your Skool Group at No Cost

While creating your own <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a> incurs a fee, Skool has implemented an automatic affiliate system. If someone creates a group through your group, you receive a 40% commission for life ($39 per month per group). This means if three people create groups from yours, you've recouped the monthly cost plus an additional $18.

## Skool Customer Support

Personally, I haven't needed to request support in a full year of using Skool; the platform is self-explanatory. However, if you do require assistance, you can contact the Skool team via email. I've heard they respond quite promptly.

You can also pose questions or engage with the Skool team in the public Skool community. In the public community, you can expect to receive an answer within a few hours, either from the Skool team or other Skool users.

## Conclusion: Is Skool Worth the Investment?

Skool is devoid of superfluous features, incredibly user-friendly, and the integration of community management, course delivery, and event scheduling on a single platform works exceptionally well.

The learning curve for Skool is minimal, approximately 3 seconds, for both members and administrators. This makes the platform accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical proficiency. When someone joins your <a href="https://www.skool.com/games?ref=e33d1c3fe5da49108d7872d5a9a3dbcb" rel="nofollow">Skool group</a>, they won't be overwhelmed by confusing features or options cluttering the screen, which can significantly detract from your members' overall experience.

This also means Skool is particularly suitable if you have a course or want to establish a community for a "non-technical" target audience. Once your group gains momentum, Skool offers robust mechanisms to expand your group and retain members, while simultaneously avoiding overwhelming them with alerts, notifications, and emails.

**Do you sell courses?** The fantastic aspect of Skool is that it allows you to place a community at the heart of your customers' learning experience. Courses without a community can feel isolating, monotonous, and considerably less engaging. With Skool, your customers will experience greater excitement, accountability, and motivation to persist in working towards their goals as they feel part of something larger than themselves.

Who wouldn't want higher course completion rates and increased success for their customers? The ability for people to connect (via the community and direct chat) means they can easily assist each other when they encounter obstacles, rather than solely relying on you for support.

### The Icing on the Cake?

Gamification, which provides all community members with a shared objective: to contribute as much value as possible to unlock course material or any other rewards you've defined. This facilitates faster and more substantial community growth with minimal effort on your part.

**Skool reviews consistently highlight three potential drawbacks, but solutions exist for all of them:**

1. Skool requires external hosting for video content.
2. There are no built-in student assessment tools.
3. The price could be a hurdle for some users.

When Sam Ovens introduced Skool, he stated: "Skool provides everything you need, and nothing you don't." After utilizing Skool for 12 months, I can confidently affirm this statement.
